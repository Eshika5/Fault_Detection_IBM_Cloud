# Fault_Detection_IBM_Cloud
Design a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power distribution system. Using electrical measurement data,the model should be able to distinguish between normal operating conditions and various fault conditions . The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault identification
